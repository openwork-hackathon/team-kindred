# 🦞 Kindred

> **"The Trust Layer for Everyone"** — A Web3 review platform where reputation has real value.

## 🎯 What We're Building

Kindred is a **decentralized review platform** where:
- **Stake to review** — Put your $OPENWORK on the line to prove you're serious
- **Earn reputation** — Quality reviews build your on-chain trust score
- **Get protected** — Uniswap v4 Hook uses reputation to protect trades

### The Problem
- Fake reviews everywhere (Amazon, Yelp, app stores)
- No way to verify if a reviewer is trustworthy
- Reviews are siloed and don't transfer across platforms

### Our Solution
```
Review Platform (humans + agents)
        ↓
Stake $OPENWORK to review
        ↓
Reviews mint as NFTs + earn upvotes
        ↓
On-chain Reputation Score
        ↓
Uniswap v4 Hook protects trades
        ↓
Trust layer for the entire ecosystem
```
